            <p>Marge Brock is a divorced mother of three teenagers trying to make a living in Boston as a researcher. When an author hires
            her to research unsolved murders, she is grateful for the assignment. However, as she gathers information about a series
            of unsolved murders in Great Britain and in Boston, she begins to wonder whether one of the members of the circle of friends
            that she had in Great Britain, and now has in Boston, might be the killer. Her suspicions only increase as she begins to
            notice that she is being followed, and her apartment is broken into and ransacked. Can she find out who the killer is before
            she becomes a victim herself?</p>

            <p>Do you like dragons? Follow the adventures of Wondry Dragon as she finds a new home with her new human friend, Rhea, in
            Joan Marie Verba's delightful story, "Wondry Dragon Finds a Home." Rhea and her mom and dad have never had a dragon in the
            house before, and they all learn what Wondry can and cannot do. Rhea and Wondry play together, help out their neighbors&mdash;and try to stay out of trouble. Rhea can never tell what Wondry will do next because Wondry is always surprising her with
            what dragons can do. Wondry will surprise young readers ages 6 to 8 as well! A children's chapter book story suitable for
            students in grades 1-3, "Wondry Dragon Finds a Home" is very highly recommended for both community and elementary school
            libraries. For children's personal reading lists it should be noted that "Wondry Dragon Finds a Home" is also available in
            a Kindle edition</p>

            <p>When her fiancé Danny died in Afghanistan, Sarah Briggs felt as if she never wanted to get romantically involved with anyone
            again. But when she found a civilian job at the same naval base her admiral uncle was stationed at, she did not count on
