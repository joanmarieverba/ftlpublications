            <p>The women at Modern Surprises LLC, needed someone to answer the phones. Jay Ecklund was hired. From the very first day, he
            found this was no ordinary company: the science division there had secretly developed a portal that would allow them to go
            to anywhere on Earth. Madeline Chang, a military veteran and owner of Modern Surprises, had a plan: to use the portal as
            a device to help those in need. However, billionaire industrialist Charles Vance found out about the portal, and was willing
            to lie, cheat, and steal to get it for himself. But Madeline, Jay, and the rest of the team were not about to let him have
            it.</p> 
            <p>A note from the author: if you enjoy television shows that show how science works,
            <em>Modern Surprises</em> is for you. I definitely had fun with the novel, and intended for the characters to have fun, as well&mdash;because
            I believe science is fun (I have a physics degree). Through the novel, readers experience how technology needs to be tested,
            how there are are unexpected effects, and how technology doesn’t always work in the way the original design indicated it
            might (and that can be delightful). When the characters find that the portal, Arachne, responds to music, it adds yet another
            dimension to the technology. I hope you’ll have fun with the story, too.</p>

            <p>Joan’s prose is always cool, it’s a majority female team and that’s such a good title.</p>
            <p><strong>Keith R.A. DeCandido, IAMTW Grandmaster, author of <em>Dragon Precinct</em></strong></p>
            <p>Modern Surprises [is] a delightful adventure story. This book is tremendous fun, and has a lot of really strong, fascinating
            characters, most of whom happen to be female. Really groovy stuff, and you should check it out. </p>

                <p>Leah came to Autumn World only to observe. But when her survey ship crashes, and the other survivors, traumatized, run away,
                she finds herself in the midst of a political and religious struggle on an alien world she barely knows.</p>

                <p><strong>Midwest Book Review (Philip E. Kaveny)</strong></p>
                <p>The novel is well-crafted and a very good read with lots sf world-building detail which takes place on a heavier-than-earth-gravity
                planet with some really neat aliens. It is a lot better than 90% of the stuff that you can find on a rack at...the big chain
                bookstores.</p>

                <p><strong><em>Mythprint</em> (Laura Krentz)</strong></p>
                <p> This is a complex and fascinating science fiction story with a well-developed but very alien world. ... Some of the aliens
                are extremely alien compared to humans, though they usually have understandable motivations. The book would appeal to young
                readers as well as adult readers.</p>
