                <p>Before the Internet, before PCs and MACs became common household items, at the dawn of the era of VCRs,
                Star Trek fans were making history. In Boldly Writing, Joan Marie Verba chronicles the development of Star Trek fanfiction,
                Star Trek conventions (the first Star Trek convention may not be the one you're thinking of), Star Trek clubs, and Star Trek
                revival efforts. Boldly Writing tells how the term “Mary Sue” came into being, and follows the fan and fanfiction discussions
                and controversies of the era. At a time when fan communication was conducted largely through the mails, and fanfiction circulated
                through fanzines printed on spirit duplicators and mimeographs and offset printers, Star Trekfans created a lively and active
                fandom that continues today.“This book pulls together an incredible amount of information about the history of fandom and
                does a major service for anyone who either wants to relive those exciting years or to better understand how Star Trek emerged
                as such a national and international phenomenon. I'll give you a clue. If Star Trek lives, it's because of what early fans
                like Verba made of it. I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in fandom (which increasingly means anyone interested
                in popular culture).”—Henry Jenkins, author of Textual Poachers: Television Fans and Participatory Culture. </p>
                
                <p>"Joan Marie Verba
                brings back to life the heady days ofStar Trek fandom, chronicling the fight to revive the original series and detailing
                the controversy and the gossip that fueled the first twenty years and gave birth to generations of wonderful poets and writers.
                I couldn't stop myself from dipping into this fascinating history." —Siddig El Fadil/Alexander Siddig, Star Trek: Deep Space
                Nine</p>
                
                <p>“Thank you for your Boldly Writing. I found it most informative, especially in light of where [the] Star Trek fanzine
                is now. It’s come a long way. Congratulations and continued success.”—Andrew Robinson, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine </p>
                
   
                
            <p>“Yesterday ... the galley proofs to Boldly Writing by Joan Marie Verba arrived in the mail .... I had no idea her fanzine
            history was such an ambitious work. I advise any Star Trek fan who wasn’t around in 1969 to order a copy .... She has taken
            the amorphous welter of material that came off the fan pressesand revealed a sharp, clear, and most of all, documented, print. She has shown us how Star Trekfandom was a force that gathered
            in, energized, trained, and produced people who have since then racked up an astounding list of achievements....”–Jacqueline
            Lichtenberg, review  "I have nothing but praise for this monumental work!”—Jacqueline Lichtenberg, co-author of Star Trek Lives!</p>

            <p>  "Little did I know on
                September 8, 1966 that watching a new television show would profoundly change my life. Star Trek has been inextricably woven
                into my existence ever since. In Boldly Writing, Joan Marie Verba chronicles the height of the fanzine phenomenon.... Joan's
                book is an amazing reminder of all those stories we shared, those dreams we dreamed, as we went where no fandom had gone
                before." —Jean Lorrah, author of The Vulcan Academy Murders, The IDIC Epidemic, Metamorphosis, and Survivors</p>
