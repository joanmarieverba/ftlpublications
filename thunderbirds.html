                <p>After his wife dies in a tragic accident, astronaut Jeff Tracy is left with five young sons to raise. But he turns his grief
                into a dream: to create an organization which will rescue people that no one else can reach. He builds a business which creates
                the new technology that the organization will require and earns the billions he needs to finance it. At last, he is ready
                to put it all together. He enlists the services of a genius to design aircraft and supporting machinery far beyond the standards
                of his time. Together, they find a South Pacific island to use as the base of their operations. Then he asks his five sons,
                now grown, to give up promising careers to build the base, operate the machines, and serve in his organization. But he finds
                that in order to make his dream a reality, it will require sacrifice, courage, and determination...far beyond what he, or
                his sons, ever expected. Can they make International Rescue a reality, and what will it take to make the fabulous Thunderbirds
                machines GO?</p>
                <p><strong>Midwest Book Review: Small Press Bookwatch</strong></p>
                <p>Tragedy does strange things to people, and it is not always negative. <em>Countdown to Action!</em></Countdown> is a novel based on the beginnings
                of the old television program Thunderbirds. When faced with his wife's death, Jeff Tracy calls upon his sons to create an
                organization dedicated to rescuing those who need it. Creating such an organization, however, is much easier said than done.
                <em>Countdown to Action!</em></Countdown> is highly recommended reading for science fiction enthusiasts in general and fans of the Thunderbirds
                television series in particular.</p>

                <p><strong>What readers say about <em>Countdown to Action!</em></strong></p>

                <p><strong>Daria H. Brooks, author of <em>A Legacy of the Pacific</em></strong></p>
                <p><em>Countdown to Action!</em> [is] a book to read and remember. It's also a thoroughly enjoyable, adventurous outing with characters
                who are beloved by fans around the world. The novel begins by filling in an element which has been largely neglected in Thunderbirds
                lore as it tells us about the relationship which brought those valiant Tracy brothers into our lives. My fascination with
                the series has always been more about what compels this amazing family to risk their lives time and time again, as well as
                about what in their collective background prepared them for their hazardous chosen task. Scott, Virgil, John, Gordon and
                Alan all had their own fields of study and interests outside of the family and were on their individual ways to gaining fame
                in their own right, away from their famous father's shadow. <em>Countdown to Action!</em> illustrates in seamless order how Jeff Tracy
                raised five such selfless and brave sons to maturity, gifting the world with young men who were willing to sacrifice their
                own personal lives and safety to save those in mortal peril time and time again. Countdown To Action successfully delves
                into the formation of the core of International Rescue and so much more, making it a very satisfying introduction to an exciting
                new series. </p>
                <p><strong>David Tremont, Model maker, Weta Workshop, New Zealand</strong></p>
                <p>Thunderbirds has been my inspiration since childhood. This has been an enjoyable read and reliving of the characters and
                their history. I look forward to new adventures ahead as should fans old and new, too.</p>
                <p><strong>Doug Pratt,  owner, Pratt Hobbies, Herndon, VA</strong></p>
                <p>I encourage you to order copies&mdash;they are wonderful books. If you are new to Thunderbirds, they will be an excellent introduction.
                If they Tracy family are old friends, you will find these stories deepen your understanding and enrich your memories. That's
                what good books are supposed to do. I'm delighted to have the chance to spread this fine work around, and to share something
                that has been very important to me. Something in the program resonated. The idea of selfless, honorable people devoting their
                lives to rescuing strangers, maybe. Or maybe it was the technology; nothing in Thunderbirds is what it appears to be. Swimming
                pools are rocket hangars, cars have machine guns, watches and powder compacts communicate with satellites. And Joan, I have
                to tell you, I've given away 18 books...so far. I'm getting emails back already about how much people are enjoying them.
                At least three parents told me they took the books out of the packages and read them before [giving them to their children
                to read].</p>
                <p><strong>Monica Ferris, USA Today bestselling author of <em>Crewel World</em> and other Needlecraft Mysteries St. Louis Park, MN</strong></p>
                <p>Verba has created a humane and human background for these characters, with foibles and weaknesses believably overcome, which
                makes their forming a brave, self-sacrificing force all the more credit-worthy.  FAB!</p>
                <p><strong>Darlene J. McCurdy, Harrisburg, PA</strong></p>
                <p>I have read the 3 books from the Thunderbird series and can honestly say once I read the first page I couldn't put it down.
                It kept me wanting more and looking forward to the next book in the series.  Anyone who loves action books, would love the
                Thunderbirds Books.  They are great for kids and adults. I passed them on to my grandson and he loves them also.</p>
                <p><strong>Vickie Vanderpool, Indianola, IA</strong></p>
                <p>My grandson loved your second novel.  It took him only a week to read through it. He wanted me to drop you a line and say
                "WELL DONE."  After he finished I read it to his younger brothers and he sat in to listen again. Amazing; he doesn't sit
                still very often. I see that you'll have a new one coming in 2010. Fantastic!!!!!! We can't wait to read this one also.</p>

                <p>All the Tracys are dedicated men of action, and Scott Tracy is no exception! The eldest of Jeff Tracy's sons, Scott pilots
                the rocket-reconnaissance aircraft, Thunderbird 1. First to arrive at any disaster scene, he evaluates the situation and
                coordinates the team's rescue strategy on site. Due to the importance of Thunderbird 1 to International Rescue's operation,
                Scott is present for nearly every rescue mission. Nonetheless, even Scott has his limitations, and in Action Alert, he stretches
                himself to those very limits. Can he do so without consequences to himself and International Rescue?</p>
